# FPandA_Churn_Model
Using Decision Tree Classification Model to predict customer churn.


# Data & Work
Data understanding - Interestingly this is not actually SyriaTel Customer data as SyriaTel was one of the two largest telicom providers in Syria and the data is of customers in all of the 50 USA states. Data on the referance site has little to no background info on this data.

CLeaning - Dropped personally identifying info. Data was fairly clean from start and did not need null handling after using pd.get_dummies to dummie out the necissary columns. 
Cleaning can be found in the multiple files other than the final file (plan to circle back on this project after bootcamp to finalize project - want to keep my work resources for referance at that time).

Analysis - referance 'Churn Analysis - Final File' for work analysis. Decision Tree was developed to predict Churn customers.
